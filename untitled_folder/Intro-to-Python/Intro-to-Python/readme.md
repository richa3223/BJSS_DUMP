# Introduction to Python 2 Day Course

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course.

## Dependencies

The course uses Jupyter Notebooks, and the python libraries 'pandas', 'matplotlib', 'statsmodels'.

## Content

‘Introduction to Python’ aims to introduce general python syntax and programming concepts. It focuses particularly on the ‘pandas’ library, the current industry and academic standard for practical, real-world data analysis in python. The course uses Jupyter Notebooks to create interactive documents that contain live python code, analysis outputs,  visualisations, and supporting text.  
By the end of the course, students will have an introductory appreciation of the use of python for data analysis. They will be able to read data into python, complete basic data manipulation tasks, and perform simple analyses and visualisations.

*Day 1 - Learning Objectives*

By the end of the day, participants will:
* Be familiar with the Jupyter notebook, which is used to interact with python.
* Understand python's basic data types - integers, floats, strings and Booleans.
* Have explored python's general data structure objects - lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
* Have taken a first look at 'pandas', python's data manipulation and analysis library, including:
 * Selecting columns, filtering rows and generating new variables.

*Day 2 - Learning Objectives*

By the end of the day, participants will:

* Have established a working knowledge of pandas, including:
 * Describing numeric and categorical data, basic descriptive statistics.
 * Aggregating and cross-tabulating data.
 * Merging data
* Understand how functions work in Python.
